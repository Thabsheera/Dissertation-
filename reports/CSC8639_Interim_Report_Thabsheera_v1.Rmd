## Introduction

Technology had succeeded in increasing the life-span of human over the years. But not everyone is living a wealthy, healthy and a happy older life.
So it's crucial for science to advance in order to improve the quality of life and not just adding years to life. 

Ageing Intelligence is a new term coined by Nic Palmarini (Director or UK National Innovation Centre for Ageing - NICA). According to him ageing intelligence is a comprehensive data-driven approach, leveraging a combination of human knowledge and experience, data analysis, and real-world applied testing and research.

Analysing the trend and generating and amplifying insights from behavioural and market data is one of the key aspects of ageing intelligence. Behavioural data is a very important data irrespective of the domain. If it is an e-commerce market, behavioural data of customers can help in better recommendations and personalisations. When it comes to the behavioural data of older population in the country, it leads to numerous opportunity benefiting both the citizen and business. By knowing what an individual will be doing at a particular time of the day, 




what is the future

how predicting a behaviour can improve lifestyle



## Project Aim

UK time survey data for 2014-15 has diary data for 4,000 households in the UK. Each diary data contains what that individual is doing at a particular time of the day. The high-level aim of this project is to predict what that person will be doing at a given time of the day. This project will require incorporating a classification model (like decision tree or random forest) into a time series component. Because diary data has time series aspect to it and the activities are categorical variables. 

Along with predicting the activities of older adults at a given hour of the day, combining two machine learning techniques adds a high value to this project.



## Progress 


Significant number of papers have been read to understand the past work using diary data and behavioural analytics. 

Accoring to : 

The available data is obtained from UK time-survey data for the period of 2014-15. The data contains diary activities by around 8000 people from 4000 households in the UK. The data is already with a given weight for household and individual so that this will be comparable to the entire UK population. The granularity of the data is household, person, weekday/weekend, 10 minute interval of the day.  

Basic EDA is conducted on the entire data to understand the distribution. Following are the major findings from the data:

1. Age group level 
2. these kind of activities happen more during weekdays
3. People over 60 does more of this than other 
4. Household without children tend to do these activities compared to adults only households.
5. Most folks enjoy doing self care but a few of this age group enjoy doing travelling more 

To visualise the above findings, a R Shiny dashboard is built. 


When it comes to behaviour classification, the data needs to be prepared in a certain way. First of all the important field like activity needed tweaking.
The activities are micro behaviour like vehicle maintenance, dwelling repair, visiting historic site etc. There are 276 such behaviours which will increase the complexity of a classification model by will requiring 276 output groups. So these micro behaviours are then grouped into 48 groups. For example, activities/ behaviours like feeding the child, teaching the child etc is now under a group called 'child care'. This will reduce the complexity of the model. 

The activities are recorded for every 10 minute interval of the day, this interval is then converted to hour of the day. So that instead of 144 time interval, 24 time intervals can be used for predicting the activities in that interval. 
The 10 minute interval is avoided since most of the activities overlap the intervals. To convert the data into hour level, the activity is replaced with the most frequent activity in that hour.

Below is the rough work plan for the project
